# youtube-api-analysis
This is a data analysis portfolio project written in Python  sing Youtube API. I analyzed the YouTube channel of Oliver Austria, a Filipino architect, and content creator. My analysis consisted of views per video, ranks of uploaded videos, views vs. likes and comments, video duration, and video titles.
